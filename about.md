We live in an era of heightened mistrust in our institutions. Should we rely on the medical establishment to tell us how to vaccinate our kids? Are universities too woke? Should the government be funding scientific research? My goal in this podcast is not to answer those questions, but to provide you with the information to come to your own conclusions - from within the heart of The Cathedral itself.

The Cathedral is a symbol, then, of the academic establishment. Credit for this metaphor goes to a blogger named Curtis Yarvin, who happens to be a monarchist with quite radical political views, among which are the dismantling of academia and the media. On a more personal note, I am currently residing in Pittsburgh, which is home to the magnificent Cathedral of Learning.

My name is Tyler Yasaka, and I'm in a dual-degree MD/PhD program studying liver biology. I grew up in a small town in Alabama, well outside the academic establishment. Until I began pursuing this career, scientific research felt inaccessible to me. My goal with this podcast is to increase transparency into the academic establishment, particularly in biomedical research, through thought-provoking conversations with some of the brightest minds in science. This is and always will be a side project for me, and I will not run ads or make a penny from this work. All opinions I express are my own.
